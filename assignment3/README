Error curves png files nomenclature
-----------------------------------

error-curve-<num_hidden_neurons>-<eta>[var<ratio>]-<error_threshold>[-<num_training_images>].png

If var<ratio> is mentioned with eta, it means that an adaptive step size is
used with a starting value of the given eta. eta does not vary on each step
size, but instead varies whenever the average error of the last five iterations
begins increasing rather than decreasing. The error is multiplied by <ratio>
every such time. Default ratio is 1, that is, this is not done.

If <num_training_images> is not specified, default number of tarining images is
1000.
